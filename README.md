# Predicting-the-reaction-output
In pharmaceutical and chemical research, optimizing reaction conditions to maximize product yield has historically been a resource-intensive process. This empirical approach requires substantial time and financial investment, creating major bottlenecks in drug development and chemical manufacturing.

Our project addresses this challenge by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including both classic and ensemble methods and modern neural networks, to predict reaction yields before laboratory experimentation.

*The primary goal:* develop accurate predictive models that can forecast chemical reaction yields based on reaction parameters.
